== PROJECT: JelphaBot

'''

== Overview

JelphaBot is a desktop application integrated with various features for managing tasks efficiently, mainly focusing on
NUS students as our target group. It is specially designed by my talented crew of teammates, together with myself.

JelphaBot was developed for our software engineering module, CS2103T, where we were tasked to morph an address book
application that manages contact details into something else. As part of the project constraints, user interactions are
primarily Command-Line Interface (CLI), assisted with a GUI created using JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 12 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

This section contains a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to my team project.

* *Major enhancement*: Implemented the Calendar feature

.UI of Calendar Tab Feature

** What it does: Literally a calendar integrated to display a monthly calendar of overarching tasks due,
together with a task list panel on the left for detailed tasks to be shown.
*** Allow users to navigate to other months of their choice.
*** Allow users to view specific tasks due to be listed on selected dates.
*** Allow users to navigate directly to today's date of the calendar view, as well as listing out the tasks due today.

** Justification:
*** The use of a calendar to display a visual view of these information is neat and easy to navigate, making the feature
more user-friendly.
*** Integrating a calendar allows users to be able to plan their schedules easily by being able to immediately
visualise which days are busier with more tasks on hand.

** Highlights:
*** The overarching view of the tasks displayed on the calendar (shown by the dot indicators) is done by filtering the
existing main task list.
*** The implementation was challenging as it required constant updates to be accounted for after other commands which
edits the main task list is input.
*** Moreover, to avoid user mistakes and increase the feature's usability, the included commands implementation in
carrying out various functions as listed above uses the same command keyword : `calendar`. This involved the heavy use
and interaction between the `Ui`, `Logic`, and `Model` components.

//** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: Added in the panel of tabs in the main Ui layout during initial stages.
This was done for the subsequence integration of our individual features.
