== Preface

=== Introduction

Welcome to JelphaBot! +
If you are just starting out, the quick start section below will help you get JelphaBot started right away!
It will equip you with the basics so that you can quickly enjoy and master the features offered.

JelphaBot is *a desktop app for managing tasks* specially designed by and for NUS students that allows you to *recognise important tasks at a glance* so that you can prioritise commitments and manage your time.

You can enter commands in JelphaBot through a *Command Line Interface* (CLI), which means that if you can *type quickly*, JelphaBot can help you get work done faster than a traditional mouse-controlled Graphical User Interface (GUI), *while still retaining the benefits of a beautiful user interface*.

Upon running JelphaBot, you will see various components on it's main display screen.
The components of the main screen is labelled below.

The function of each component is as follows:

. *Menu bar*: You can access common commands such as `help` and `exit` by clicking the menu items here.
. *Tabs Pane*: This is where you can navigate between the different features located in various tabs.
. *Main Panel*: This is the main display screen which corresponds to the tab it is under.
. *Results Display*: This is where JelphaBot interacts with you by showing you the results of your commands!
. *Command Box*: This is where you key in your commands.

As seen from above, JelphaBot has five tabs; <<Summary (Eden), Summary>>, <<Managing Tasks (Yao Jie), Task List>>, <<Calendar (Amanda), Calendar>>, <<Productivity Tracking (Jel), Productivity>> and <<Set Reminders (Dian Hao), Reminder>>.
Each tab provides a specific feature aimed to help you manage your tasks and deadlines more productively!

The start of every task is labelled with a module code so that you can visually categorize them.
Tasks are tagged according to their importance:

* Default priority

* _Low priority_ tasks will be _italicized_ to denote optional tasks.

The start of every task will be labelled with a module code so that you can visually categorize them. +
Go <<#add, here>> to read more about adding tasks with priority and <<#edit, here>> for editing task priority.

====
*Command Format for Task list commands*

* Parts of the command in `UPPER_CASE` represent command parameters that have to be supplied by you. +
e.g. in `add d/DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` represents a field where you can provide the appropriate description, such as `add d/Assignment 1`.
* Parameters in square brackets are optional e.g `d/DESCRIPTION [p/PRIORITY]` can be used as `d/Assignment 1 p/0` or as `d/Assignment 1`.
* Parameters with a trailing `…` ​can be used as many times as you want, or can also be omitted. +
e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used once as `t/project`, or multiple times like `t/project t/graded`, and so on.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `d/DESCRIPTION p/PRIORITY`, `p/PRIORITY d/DESCRIPTION` is also acceptable.
