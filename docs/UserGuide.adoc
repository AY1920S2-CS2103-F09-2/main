== Preface
=== Introduction
Welcome to JelphaBot! +
If you are just starting out, the quick start section below will help you get JelphaBot started right
away! It will equip you with the basics so that you can quickly enjoy and master the features offered.

JelphaBot is *a desktop app for managing tasks* specially designed by and for NUS students that allows you to
*recognise important tasks at a glance* so that you can prioritise commitments and manage your time.

You can enter commands in JelphaBot through a *Command Line Interface* (CLI), which means that if you can *type quickly*,
JelphaBot can help you get work done faster than a traditional mouse-controlled Graphical User Interface (GUI),
*while still retaining the benefits of a beautiful user interface*.

Upon running JelphaBot, you will see various components on it's main display screen. The components of the main screen is labelled below.

[.text-center]
.Brief overview of the app
image::MainUi.png[width="600"]

The function of each component is as follows:

1. *Tabs Panel*: This is where you can navigate between the different features located in various tabs.
2. *Main Panel*: This is the main display screen which corresponds to the tab it is under.
3. *Results Display*: This is where JelphaBot interacts with you by showing you the results of your commands!
4. *Command Box*: This is where you key in your commands.

As seen from above, JelphaBot has four tabs; Summary, Task List, Calendar and Productivity.
You can switch between tabs anytime by pressing kbd:[Ctrl] + kbd:[Tab] on your keyboard to move to the tab on the right.
If you are already on the rightmost tab, it wraps around to the leftmost tab.

====
*Command Format for Task list commands*

These command formats are applicable for the following commands: +
`add`, `edit`, `find`.

* Parts of the command in `UPPER_CASE` represent command parameters that have to be supplied by you. +
e.g. in `add d/DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` represents a field where you can provide the appropriate description, such as `add d/Assignment 1`.
* Parameters in square brackets are optional e.g `d/DESCRIPTION [p/PRIORITY]` can be used as `d/Assignment 1 p/0` or as `d/Assignment 1`.
* Parameters with a trailing `…`​can be used as many times as you want, or can also be omitted. +
e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `t/project`, `t/project t/graded` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `d/DESCRIPTION p/PRIORITY`, `p/PRIORITY d/DESCRIPTION` is also acceptable.
====

==== Reading the Task List

The task list is formatted so that you can distinguish urgent tasks at first glance. The start of every task is labelled
with a module code so that you can visually categorize them. Tasks are tagged according to their importance:

* Default priority
* *High Priority* tasks will be *bolded* to denote important tasks.
* _Low priority_ tasks will be _italicized_ to denote optional tasks.

The start of every task will be labelled with a module code so that you can visually categorize them. +
Go <<#add, here>> to read more about adding tasks with priority and <<#edit, here>> for editing task priority.

// tag::add[]
[[add]]
