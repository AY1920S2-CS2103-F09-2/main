== Preface
=== Introduction
Welcome to JelphaBot! +
If you are just starting out, this quick start section will help you get JelphaBot started right
away! It will equip you with the basics so that you can quickly enjoy and master the features offered.

JelphaBot is *a desktop app for managing tasks* specially designed by and for NUS students that allows you to
*recognise important tasks at a glance* so that you can prioritise commitments and manage your time.

You can enter commands in JelphaBot through a *Command Line Interface* (CLI), which means that if you can *type quickly*,
JelphaBot can help you get work done faster than a traditional mouse-controlled Graphical User Interface (GUI),
*while still retaining the benefits of a beautiful user interface*.

Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started.
Enjoy!

*Command Format*

**Task list commands**

These command formats are applicable for the following commands: +
Add Command, Edit Command, Find Command.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add d/DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used as `add d/Assignment 1`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `d/DESCRIPTION [p/PRIORITY]` can be used as `d/Assignment 1 p/0` or as `d/Assignment 1`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/project`, `t/project t/graded` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `d/DESCRIPTION p/PRIORITY`, `p/PRIORITY d/DESCRIPTION` is also acceptable.

==== Reading the task list

The task list is formatted so that you can distinguish urgent tasks at first glance. The start of every task is labelled
with a module code so that you can visually categorize them. Tasks are tagged according to their importance:

* Default priority
* *High Priority* tasks will be *bolded* to denote important tasks.
* _Low priority_ tasks will be _italicized_ to denote optional tasks.

The start of every task will be labelled with a module code so that you can visually categorize them.
Go <<#add, here>> to read more about adding tasks with priority and <<#edit, here>> for editing task priority.

You can also tag tasks with additional information. To read more about tags, go <<#Tags, here>>

// tag::add[]
