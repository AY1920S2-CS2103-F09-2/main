== Preface
=== Introduction
Welcome to JelphaBot! +
If you are just starting out, the quick start section below will help you get JelphaBot started right
away! It will equip you with the basics so that you can quickly enjoy and master the features offered.

JelphaBot is *a desktop app for managing tasks* specially designed by and for NUS students that allows you to
*recognise important tasks at a glance* so that you can prioritise commitments and manage your time.

You can enter commands in JelphaBot through a *Command Line Interface* (CLI), which means that if you can *type quickly*,
JelphaBot can help you get work done faster than a traditional mouse-controlled Graphical User Interface (GUI),
*while still retaining the benefits of a beautiful user interface*.

Upon running JelphaBot, you will see various components on it's main display screen. The components of the main screen is labelled below.

[.text-center]
.Brief overview of the app
image::MainUi.png[width="600"]

The function of each component is as follows:

1. *Tabs Panel*: This is where you can navigate between the different features located in various tabs.
2. *Main Panel*: This is the main display screen which corresponds to the tab it is under.
3. *Results Display*: This is where JelphaBot interacts with you by showing you the results of your commands!
4. *Command Box*: This is where you key in your commands.

As seen from above, JelphaBot has four tabs; Summary, Task List, Calendar and Productivity.
You can switch between tabs anytime by pressing kbd:[Ctrl] + kbd:[Tab] on your keyboard to move to the tab on the right.
If you are already on the rightmost tab, it wraps around to the leftmost tab.

e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `t/project`, `t/project t/graded` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `d/DESCRIPTION p/PRIORITY`, `p/PRIORITY d/DESCRIPTION` is also acceptable.
