== Introduction

JelphaBot is designed for users who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing tasks*.
If you *prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI), JelphaBot allows you to work fast while still retaining the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, JelphaBot can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

The JelphaBot GUI is designed to allow you to *recognise important tasks at first glance* so that you can prioritise commitments and manage your time.

. Download the latest `jelphabot.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your JelphaBot.
. Double-click the file to start the app.
The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

== Features
====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add d/DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used as `add d/Assignment 1`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `d/DESCRIPTION [p/PRIORITY]` can be used as `d/Assignment 1 p/0` or as `d/Assignment 1`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/project`, `t/project t/graded` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `d/DESCRIPTION p/PRIORITY`, `p/PRIORITY d/DESCRIPTION` is also acceptable.

==== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

Opens a help popup which provides a link to this user guide.

_Figure 2: Example of an expected result after running `add`_

****
* For dt/DATETIME inputs, we recommend the format MMM-dd-YYYY HH mm, but it also allows some other formats.
// TODO list datetime accepted formats here
* Values that p/PRIORITY can take are -1, 0 or 1. If not specified, DEFAULTS TO 1.
****

[TIP]
A task can have any number of tags (including 0)

Examples:

* `add add d/Assignment 1 dt/Jan-01-2020 23 59 m/CS3230 p/1`
* `add add d/Project TP dt/Jan-01-2020 23 59 m/CS2103T p/1 t/pair work`

Shows a list of all tasks in the task list. +
Format: `list`

image::ug_figures/list.png[width="600"]
_Figure 3: Example of an expected result after running `list`_

The task list is formatted so that you can distinguish urgent tasks at first glance. Tasks are tagged according to their importance:

* Default
* *Important*
* _Optional_

Deadlines that are marked as low priority (`p/-1`) will be _italicized_ to denote that there is no penalty for not meeting the deadline. (or that it denotes an approximate deadline )

Deadlines that are marked as high priority (`p/1`) will be *bolded* to denote that they are more urgent.

Tasks will be organized into drop down menus based on the following Categories:

* Now  +
(Showing tasks due within the next 4 hours)
* Today +
(Showing tasks due by the end of the day)
* This week +
(Showing tasks due by the end of the week, defined as before the next upcoming Monday)
* This month +
(Showing tasks due by the end of the month, defined as all tasks within the same Month and Year as the current date)

The start of every task will be labelled with a visual tag so that you can visually categorize them.

To read more about tags, go <<#Tags, here>>

* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* tasks matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
