== Preface
=== Introduction

JelphaBot is *a desktop app for managing tasks* for NUS students. JelphaBot is designed to allow these students
to manage tasks conveniently and aids students by *allowing important tasks to be easily recognised*.

Users enter commands in JelphaBot through a *Command Line Interface* (CLI). However, a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
is still used for improved design and user experience.

JelphaBot is based on the AddressBook-Level3 (AB3) project created by SE-EDU initiative at https://se-education.org

=== Purpose of this Document
The following section describes the software architecture and design decisions behind the implementation of JelphaBot.
This guide is intended for developers who wish to maintain, modify or understand the software development behind our application.
The guide is divided into various sections. First, it explores the overarching architecture of the software before exploring each individual component,
as well as the individual implementations of each distinct feature.

The guide is designed to be read as-needed, new developers can choose to start from the overarching view before narrowing down to the specific implementation they require.

This Developer Guide consists of the following sections:

* <<Setting Up, Setting Up>> - Assists new developers in cloning and initializing a copy of JelphaBot.
* <<Design, Design>> - Provides an overview of the architecture design.
* <<Implementation, Implementation>> - Brief explanation of how features in JelphaBot were implemented on top of AB3,
and explains the design considerations of these implementations.
* <<Documentation, Documentation>> - A guide for generating and publishing documentation.
* <<Testing, Testing>> - A guide for developers to set up and run test code.
* <<Dev Ops, Dev Ops>> - A guide for developers to build, test and release JelphaBot.

== Setting Up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

JelphaBot is a desktop app built in Java based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the SE-EDU initiative,
and inherits its architectural design. The software is split into various components, each with its own package.
Each component is in charge of a single aspect of the software.

[TIP]
The data in JelphaBot is stored as .json files in the `data` subdirectory.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture
The *_Architecture Diagram_* given below explains the high-level design of the App.

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram2.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.drawio` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
To update a diagram, import the `.drawio` file to the webapp link:{https://draw.io}[here].

Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}src/main/java/seedu/JelphaBot/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/JelphaBot/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::interaction.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component
The Ui Component handles interactions between the user and the application.
This includes input fields where commands are entered as well as translations of data in the Model Component to a visual representation in the interface.

.Class Diagram of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/JelphaBot/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `CalendarDayCard`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/JelphaBot/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component
The Logic component handles the business logic after a command is executed.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/JelphaBot/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `JelphaBotParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` and `Model` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component
The Model component provides an internal data representation of all tasks stored in JelphaBot, as well as methods to modify that data.

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/JelphaBot/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores JelphaBot data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

// TODO ignore this for now
[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `JelphaBot`, which `Task` can reference. This would allow `JelphaBot` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Task` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelMoreOOP.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component
The Storage component manages storing and retrieving of data onto local files in .json format.

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::Storage.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/JelphaBot/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save JelphaBot data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.JelphaBot.commons` package.
This includes classes which implement utility functions which can be used by all other components.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Tab System
Users may find it complicated to handle the many features that JelphaBot offers. They might also be overwhelmed if all the information of their tasks were to be displayed together in one screen.

As such, we have decided to implement a tab system for JelphaBot to organise the available commands into their respective features. JelphaBot provides 4 different tabs for the users,
each displaying a different set of panels that are relevant to the feature.

* *Summary Tab* - <<Summary feature, overall view>> of the day's tasks in the task list.
* *Task List Tab* - <<Task Grouping feature in Task List tab, view all tasks>> in the task list.
* *Calendar Tab* - <<Calendar feature, visualisation>> of tasks in a specific day or month.
* *Productivity Tab* - <<Productivity feature, overarching view>> of overall productivity such as task completion rate.

To use the different features, we have also implemented commands for users to switch between the 4 tabs.

[[ChangeTab]]
// tag::changetab[]
==== Current Implementation

[[ChangingTabs]]
===== Switching between Tabs in Main Window

The tabs of the application are defined using a [.java]#SwitchTab# enum and the current tab of the application is stored as a private attribute [.java]#mode# in [.java]#LogicManager#. Users can switch between tabs in JelphaBot using the lower case names of each tab as commands (e.g. `calendar`). When the tab of the application is changed, we need to update the:

* [.java]#MainWindow# component so that the [.java]#SwitchTab# attribute in [.java]#MainWindow# reflects the new current tab, since this is used to check if a command can be executed,
* [.java]#UI# component so that the panels display the information that is relevant to the tab.


IMPORTANT: `task list` is not a valid command to switch to the Task List tab. Use `list` instead.

For all these commands, updates are done by updating the [.java]#SwitchTab# attribute added in the [.java]#CommandResult# object. As an example, the figure below shows the sequence diagram for when a user executes the `:p` command:

.Component interactions for `:p` command
// TODO: insert diagram

Upon execution of the `:p` command, [.java]#ProductivityCommand#generateCommandResult()# will generate a [.java]#CommandResult# whose [.java]#SwitchTab# attribute is set to [.java]#PRODUCTIVITY# and return it to the [.java]#LogicManager#. Now, the updates can be done for the respective components:

* [.java]#UI# component: [.java]#MainWindow# calls [.java]#MainWindow#executeCommand()#, to retrieve the tab to be changed to and updates the current tab stored in its [.java]#SwitchTab# attribute by calling [.java]#CommandResult#isShow{XXX}()# where XXX is the tab to switch to.
The display panel is updated by calling [.java]#MainWindow#handle{XXX} where XXX is the tab to switch to.

// end::changetab[]
// TODO: complete this section

// tag::taskgroups[]
=== Task Grouping feature in Task List tab
==== Implementation

The task category mechanism is facilitated by the `ViewTaskList` interface, which serves as a wrapper for any list of tasks. +
The ViewTaskList interface supports methods that facilitate getting and iterating through the tasks contained within the list.
This is to accommodate a common access for Tasks in `GroupedTaskList`, which contains multiple sub-lists. +
The diagram below describes the class structure.

.Class Diagram for Task List classes
image::TaskListClassDiagram.png[]

Grouping tasks into sub-lists is done through the `GroupedTaskList` class. +
Each `GroupedTaskList` is a container for `ObservableList<Task>` objects, each containing a unique filter over the full task list.

Each `GroupedTaskList` implements the following operations on top of those in `ViewTaskList`:

* A enum class which describes the valid `Category` groupings, and the corresponding methods of getting these groupings from a `String`. +
* An `ObservableList` of `SubgroupTaskList` that represents the sub-groupings of each corresponding `Category`.
* A public method for instantiating a `GroupedTaskList` called `getGroupedList` with the return from `getFilteredTaskList()` as argument.
* An iterator method which iterates through a list of `SubgroupTaskList`.

Users can modify the `GroupTaskList` being displayed in the main panel by executing a `ListCommand`.
The operation for retrieving the corresponding `GroupedTaskLists` are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#getGroupedTaskList(Category category)`. +
Currently, the supported groupings for JelphaBot are group by date (`GroupedTaskList.Category.DATE` and `GroupedByDateTaskList`) and group by module (`GroupedTaskList.Category.MODULE` and `GroupedByModuleTaskList`).

The following diagram shows the sequence flow of a `ListCommand` which modifies the currently shown Task List:

[[activity-swapping-groupedtasklist]]
.Activity Diagram showing the tab switch for ListCommand
image::ListCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the task category mechanism behaves at each step.

*Step 1.* The user launches the application for the first time.
The `MainWindow` will be initialized with `GroupedTaskListPanel` as a container for GroupedTaskList model objects.
The panel is populated with sublists defined in `GroupedByDateTaskList`.

*Step 2.* The user executes `list model` to switch to category tasks by module code instead. `GroupedTaskListPanel` is repopulated with sublists defined in `GroupedByModuleTaskList`.

[NOTE]
If the user tries to switch to a `Cateory` which is already set, the command does not reinitialize the `GroupedTaskList` to prevent redundant filtering operations.

As `GroupedTaskList` has more than one underlying `ObservableList<Task>`, tasks cannot be retrieved the usual way.
Thus, the `get()` function defined in the `ViewTaskList` interface must be implemented and used instead. +
The following diagram shows the process of retrieving a `Task` from `ViewTaskList` when it is an instance of `GroupedTaskList`:

[[sequence-viewtasklist-get]]
.Sequence Diagram for `ViewTaskList.get()`
image::ViewTaskListGetSequenceDiagram.png[]

As the index passed as an argument to `lastShownList.get()` is a cumulative index, the implementation of ` get()` in `ViewTaskList` has to iterate through each `SubgroupTaskList` stored within.

// TODO explain how panel is updated?
//** Pros: Provides good protection over unexpected changes on the displayed Task List.
//* *Alternative 1*: Let UI displays problems in an `ObservableList<Task>` and update the list directly.
//** Pros: This implementation is more straightforward as the logic updates the displayed list directly and all changes are reflected immediately.
//** Cons: `ObservableList` is able to be modified by the containing panel class.
==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect 1: `ListCommand` swaps to a different `ViewTaskList`

Refer <<activity-swapping-groupedtasklist, here>> for the diagram describing this process.

* *Current solution*: Initializes each grouped list as each `ListCommand` is called and stores the latest list as `Model.lastShownList`.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
Scalable when more groupings are added.
** Cons: Consecutive 'list' operations are expensive as the list is reinitalized each time.
** Cons: It is hard to keep track of the exact type of list in `lastShownList`, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
* **Alternative 1:** Keep instances of all `GroupedTaskList` objects and update them as underlying Task List changes.
** Pros: Consecutive `ListCommand` executions are less expensive.
** Cons: All other commands that update the underlying list now have additional checks as each grouped list is updated.

===== Aspect 2: `get()` Task from `ViewTaskList` and iterate between Tasks.

Refer <<activity-swapping-groupedtasklist, here>> for the diagram describing this process.

* *Current solution*: Implement `get()` and `Iterator<Task>` in `ViewTaskList`.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
Scalable when more groupings are added.
** Cons: Consecutive 'list' operations are expensive as the list is reinitalized each time.
** Cons: It is hard to keep track of the exact type of list in `lastShownList`, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
*** As a workaround, only operations defined in the `ViewTaskList` interface should be used.
* **Alternative 1:** Keep instances of all `GroupedTaskList` objects and update them as underlying Task List changes.
** Pros: Consecutive `ListCommand` executions are less expensive.
** Cons: All other commands that update the underlying `UniqueTaskList` will result in multiple update calls to `ViewTaskList`.

//===== Aspect 3: Hide empty Categories in `GroupByDateTaskList`
//
//* *Current Solution*: UI displays problems from a `FilteredList<SubgroupTaskList>` and use `filtered()` to hide empty categories without removing them.
//** Rationale: These categories are meant to be reused when applicable tasks are added back to the list.
//** Pros: The list categories do not have to be reinitalized as tasks are removed or added.
//** Cons: Additional load on the UI as the Filtering happens constantly.
//However, since there is a cap on five categories (so five `FilteredList` lists), it is unlikely to be significant.
//** Cons: Inconsistent with the way filtering is done in `GroupByModuleTaskList`, which reduces control abstraction in `GroupedTaskList`.
//* **Alternative 1:** Remove categories which are no longer used, and reinitialize them again when needed.
//** Pros: Consecutive changes to the underlying Task List are less expensive if less lists are currently active.
//** Pros: Enforce consistency with `GroupByModuleTaskList` which might allow some methods to be abstracted to parent class.
//** Cons: Empty `SubgroupTaskList` members have to be hidden manually which requires complex logic in `SubgroupTaskListPanel`.
//** Cons: Additional listeners have to be added (one for each category) to reinitialize empty categories.

===== Aspect 3: Remove empty Categories in `GroupByModuleTaskList`

* *Current Solution*: UI displays problems from a `FilteredList<SubgroupTaskList>` and uses a `ListChangeListener<Task>` to maintain a set of unique module codes when the underlying task list is changed.
The `ObservableSet<ModuleCode>` has a further `SetChangeListener<ModuleCode>` bound to it to remove categories that no longer contain any Tasks.
This second listener directly removes unused categories from `GroupedByModuleTaskList`.
** Pros: Consecutive changes to the underlying Task List are automatically reflected with a change in `SubgroupTaskList` categories.
** Pros: The delegation of responsibilities between each `Listener` allows Single Responsibility Principle to be maintained.
** Cons: Dependency between the two `Listener` classes has to be maintained.
* **Alternative 1:** Hide categories which are no longer used by adding a filter to the tasklist returned.
** Pros: Easy to implement and understand.
** Pros: Enforce consistency with `GroupByDateTaskList` which might allow some methods to be abstracted to parent class.
** Cons: Not practical: as more Module Codes are added to the Task List, it might cause more and more hidden categories to be created which are expensive to filter through.
* **Alternative 2:** Abstract maintenance of the set of unique module codes to a `UniqueModuleCodeSet` class instanced in `UniqueTaskList`.
** Pros: Easy to understand.
Logic is further abstracted to a higher level and the new class is instanced together with the list that affects it.
** Cons: Implementation is challenging and prone to bugs.
Due to the time of writing this Developer guide, the release is nearing V1.4 and time is spent fixing bugs for release instead.
** This could be a proposed update in the future.
// TODO sample diagram?

=== Calendar feature

JelphaBot has a calendar feature which provides an overarching view of their schedules and to allow users to view their tasks due.

This feature offers two main functions:

** Displays an overview of tasks in calendar for a selected month and year
** Displays a list of tasks due for a specified date

====  Implementation

The implementation of the main calendar panel is facilitated by the `CalendarMainPanel` class, which serves as the main
container for this feature. This main container consists of a `SplitPane` comprising of a `CalendarPanel` on the right,
which displays the calendar view in a month, and a `CalendarTaskListPanel` on the left to display specific tasks.

The diagram below describes the class structure of the calendar class structure.

.Class Diagram for Calendar classes
image::CalendarUiClassDiagram.png[]

Upon initialisation of the `CalendarMainPanel`, the `CalendarPanel` would be set to display the current month and year calendar,
with the dates filled up by `CalendarDayCards` by CalendarPanel#fillGridPane() with a `CalendarDate` starting from the first day of the current month.
Today's date would also be highlighted, with `CalendarTaskListPanel` set to display the tasks due today by running
Logic#getFilteredCalendarTaskList() and then Logic#updateFilteredCalendarTaskList() with a predicate to filter by today's date.

The following diagram depicts how each individual day cell of the calendar will look like:

image::CalendarDayCards.png[]

After every execution of command, MainWindow#updateTasksInCalendarDayCards() will be run such that any commands that updates
the JelphaBot task list (e.g `DoneCommand`, `DeleteCommand`, `EditCommand`) would be updated by the dot indicators in the calendar.

**Function 1: Displays an overview of tasks in calendar for a selected month and year**

This function mainly aids in navigating the calendar view. +

There are 2 commands that users can issue to perform function 1:

1. `calendar today`: Displays calendar for the current month with today's date highlighted, and its corresponding tasks due listed. +
2. `calendar MONTHYEAR`: Displays calendar for the month and year specified, with the first day of the month highlighted,
and its corresponding tasks due listed (e.g. calendar Apr-2020).

//The implementation of these 2 commands are largely similar. +

**Function 2: Display a list of tasks due for a selected date in the month**

In order to display the task list for specific input dates, the user enters the `calendar DATE` command +
(e.g. calendar Jan-1-2020).

NOTE: Only a date belonging in the current displayed month on the `CalendarPanel` would be highlighted after
processing the `calendar DATE` command. A date that falls in other month and years would just display its
corresponding tasks due on the `CalendarTaskListPanel`.

The following example sequence diagram shows you how the `calendar MONTHYEAR` (e.g. `calendar Apr-2020`) command works.

.Sequence diagram after running `calendar Apr-2020`
image::CalendarViewSequenceDiagram.png[]

Upon execution of the `calendar MONTHYEAR` command, CalendarCommand#execute() will run `updateFilteredCalendarTaskList()` to
filter the task list displaying the tasks due on the first day of the `MONTHYEAR` in the `CalendarTaskListPanel` and generate a CommandResult with the respective `MONTHYEAR`
and return it to the `LogicManager`. The CommandResult is passed to the MainWindow in UI. Now, the updates can be done for the respective components:

UI Component: Using the CommandResult, MainWindow calls MainWindow#updateCalendarMainPanel(), which is then passed to call CalendarMainPanel#updateCalendarPanel().
This updates the `CalendarPanel` display with the respective `MONTHYEAR` view, and highlights the first day of the month.

NOTE: The implementation of the other two calendar commands (`calendar DATE` and `calendar today`) are largely similar and run in the same process.
The only exception is regarding the `calendar DATE` command which fulfills **Function 2** listed above, where the `GridPane` in CalendarPanel` is not
altered by running CalendarPanel#fillGridPane() unlike the other two commands fulfilling **Function 1**. Only `CalendarTaskListPanel` is updated.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect 1: How the user can navigate between specific dates and change the calendar month view
* *Current Solution:* Use the same `calendar` command word for both viewing tasks in specific dates, and changing the calendar view.
The next input following the command word (`DATE`, `MONTHYEAR`, `today`) is then parsed separately to give different command results.
** Pros: Easier and more understandable for user interactions.
** Pros: More open and accessible to future implementations regarding the calendar feature.
** Cons: Implementation in the `CalendarCommand` class might seem a bit bulky.
* **Alternative 1:** Use completely separate commands for viewing tasks in specific dates and changing the calendar view.
** Pros: Less chance of a parse exception, with more precise error messages when invalid command formats are input by the user.
** Cons: Certain areas of the code might be repetitive.
** Cons: Less intuitive for users to use.

===== Aspect 3: Method of storing `ObservableList<Task>` of tasks for each day card (Implementation of Dot Indicator)
* *Current Solution:* Each `CalendarDayCard` stores a filtered list of tasks due on its specific date.
This is done by obtaining all the tasks in the task list from Logic#getFilteredTaskList() and applying a filter function
with the `TaskDueWithinDayPredicate`, specifically with the date of the day card. The list of tasks stored for each day card
in the calendar panel would be re-filtered after the execution of each command.
** Pros: Do not have to manually update the tasks stored in each `CalendarDayCard` (e.g add and remove manually in the separately stored copy)
** Cons: Completely reliant on the main task list, possible errors might be carried over.
* **Alternative 1:** Use a static HashMap of Dates as keys and a list of tasks due in that date as values.
** Pros: Retrieving the tasks in a specific date and storing in the day card is fast - can be done in O(1) time.
** Cons: Implementation would be much more complex.
** Cons: Updating of this HashMap of the tasks as the main task list is being edited constantly can be very tedious.

// tag::productivity[]
=== Productivity feature
JelphaBot has a productivity panel of this feature which provides an overarching view of user's overall productivity.

This feature offers two main functions:

** Start timer for a task.
** Stop running timer for a task.

====  Implementation

**Function 1: Starts timer for a specified task** +
In order to start timing a task, the user enters `start INDEX` command
(e.g. start 1)

Upon successful execution of the command, the productivity tab displays the task being timed under the Running Timer(s) header.

The following diagram shows the sequence flow of `start` which modifies the current Productivity List:

[[activity-settingProductivitylist]]
.Activity Diagram showing the setting of Productivity in the Productivity List
image::StartActivityDiagram.png[]

Update productivity panel:
[[activity-updatingProductivityPanel]]
.Activity Diagram showing the updating of the productivity panel
image::TimerPanelActivityDiagram.png[]

**Function 2: Stops timer for a specified task** +
In order to stop timing a task, the user enters `stop INDEX` command
(e.g. stop 1)

Upon successful execution of the command, the productivity tab removes the task being timed under the Running Timer(s) header.
If the timed task is due today or in the next 6 days, the time spent on the timed task will be added to either the Due today: label
or the Due in the next 6 days: label under the Time Spent on Tasks header.

[NOTE]
If the user attempts to start timer for a task marked as completed or stop a task that does not have a running timer,
the command fails its execution so that it does not execute that start or stop operation to start or stop the timer for that task.

.Sequence Diagram after running `stop 1`
image::StopSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect 1: Rendering sub-parts of productivity panel
* *Current solution*: Render each sub-part (i.e. task completion rate, time spent and running timers) only when that part needs to
be updated. All 3 parts are rendered on to the same card.
** Rationale: No need to re-render all 3 parts when changes are made to only one part.
** Pros: Easy to implement and reduces waste of computational power.
** Cons: As all parts are displayed on the same card, if there happens to be problem in other parts of the card, all parts will be affected.
* *Alternative 1*: Abstract each part to a separate card and render all cards onto the same panel.
** Pros: Allows other parts to be rendered even when there is error on one part. Additionally, it is easier to identify bugs when there is
an error in displaying.

===== Aspect 2: Allowing tasks to be added, deleted and edited while timer is running
* *Current solution*: Adding and deleting task is allowed. However, tasks cannot be edited.
** Rationale: Adding and deleting tasks does not affect the task being timed.
** Pros: Other functionality are still available for use. Thus, user's experience is not affected
** Cons: User is unable to edit changes in the task being timed.
* *Alternative 1*: Allow users to edit task while timer is running.
** Pros: User is able to use all features without restriction.
** Cons: Difficult to implement as the Task model requires a new Task to replace the old Task when edit command is executed.
// end::productivity[]

=== Reminder feature
JelphaBot has a reminder feature that reminds users whenever they have tasks that are about to overdue.
This feature offers two main functions:

** Adds a reminder to a task.
** Delete a reminder that is associated to a task.

==== Classes for Reminder feature in Model
The Reminder feature was implemented by implementing a new set of classes to model. A new Reminder class is stored in
Jelphabot's UniqueReminderList, which consists of a list of Reminders. Each Reminder consists of 3 objects:
** Index: the Task's index of which the user wants to be reminded for.
** ReminderDay: the number of days before the Task's deadline that the user wants to be reminded for.
** ReminderHour: the number of hours before the Tasks's deadline that the user wants to be reminded for.

.Reminder Class Diagram in the Model component
image::Reminderclass.png[]

==== Implementation
**Function 1: Creates a reminder for a specified task** +
To add a reminder to a certain task, the user enters the `reminder INDEX days/DAYS hours/HOURS` command.
(e.g, reminder 2 days/2 hours/1)

.Sequence Diagram after running `reminder 2 days/2 hours/1`
image::AddReminderSequenceDiagram.png[]

Upon successful execution of the command, the user adds a reminder associated to the task at `INDEX`. Upon exiting JelphaBot,
the reminder will be saved. By the next time the users starts JelphaBot, it will remind the user should the task's due date fall
within the period set by the user from the current date.

**Function 2: Deletes a reminder for a specified task** +
To delete a reminder associated to a certain task, the user enters the `delrem INDEX` command.
(e.g. delrem 2)

.Sequence Diagram after running `delrem 2`
image::DeleteReminderSequenceDiagram.png[]

Upon successful execution of the command, the reminder of the task at `INDEX` is removed.

[NOTE]
If the user attempts to add a reminder to tasks that have reminders, the command will fail to execute. The user also need not
to set reminders to tasks that are complete. However, if tasks that has reminders are not completed, JelphaBot will
still warn the user.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect 1: Implementing `Reminder` object
* *Current solution:* Implement `Reminder` as a standalone class
** Rationale: A `Reminder` is an object, with the same hierarchy to the `Task` class, with similar attributes.
** Pros: Fully capture the idea of an object-oriented design and robust in handling future changes.
** Cons: An additional storage is required to store the `Reminder` objects, which causes overhead while reading from and writing to
json files.
* *Alternative 1:* Design `Reminder` as one of the attributes of a `Task`
** Rationale: A `Reminder` can also be see as one of a `Task` 's properties, analogous with `Description` and
other properties.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Concurrent fetching and storing from the json files while reading and writing `Task` s.
** Cons: A `Reminder` has to reminder users the moment when Jelphabot is booted. At that instance, `Storage` has not
started to read `Task` s from the json files yet, therefore the `Reminder` could not be read beforehand.

===== Aspect 2: Rendering `Reminder` on `ReminderListPanel`
* *Current solution:* Shows the `Index` of the `Task` that is being reminded, the respective `ReminderDay` and `ReminderHour`.
** Pros: Clean and simple to understand.
** Cons: Users may need to refer to the `GroupedTaskListPanel` to check which `Task` the `Reminder` is associated to.
* *Alternative 1:* Shows the `Reminder` similar to how the `Task` is displayed, and includes information such as `Task`
associated.
** Pros: Comprehensive, users need not to switch panels to find out which `Task` is being reminded.
** Cons: Overcomplicated and may confuse users. Users may be confused by the `Index` s shown since `Reminder` and `Task`
both has `Index` respectively.

=== Summary feature

JelphaBot has a Summary feature which provides an overview of the tasks due within the day as well as all tasks that have been complete within the day.

This feature comes in the form of a welcome screen, which comprises of two sections for the tasks due within the day and the tasks completed within the day respectively.

For each task shown only details such as the Module Code and the Description are shown.

Once the user marks a task due within the day as complete, it will automatically appear under the tasks completed within the day.

[NOTE]
If the user marks a task as completed, and immediately deletes the task from the tasklist, it will not appear in the summary screen.

==== Implementation

To view the respective tasks, the user enters the `summary` command.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedJelphaBot`.
It extends `JelphaBot` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `jelphaBotStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedJelphaBot#commit()` -- Saves the current JelphaBot state in its history.
* `VersionedJelphaBot#undo()` -- Restores the previous JelphaBot state from its history.
* `VersionedJelphaBot#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone JelphaBot state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitJelphaBot()`, `Model#undoJelphaBot()` and `Model#redoJelphaBot()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedJelphaBot` will be initialized with the initial JelphaBot state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single JelphaBot state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th task in JelphaBot. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitJelphaBot()`, causing the modified state of JelphaBot after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `jelphaBotStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted JelphaBot state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add d/Assignment ...` to add a new task. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitJelphaBot()`, causing another modified JelphaBot state to be saved into the `jelphaBotStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitJelphaBot()`, so JelphaBot state will not be saved into the `jelphaBotStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the task was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoJelphaBot()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous JelphaBot state, and restores JelphaBot to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial JelphaBot state, then there are no previous JelphaBot states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoJelphaBot()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoJelphaBot()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores JelphaBot to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `jelphaBotStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest JelphaBot state, then there are no undone JelphaBot states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoJelphaBot()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify JelphaBot, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitJelphaBot()`, `Model#undoJelphaBot()` or `Model#redoJelphaBot()`. Thus, the `jelphaBotStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitJelphaBot()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `jelphaBotStateList`, all JelphaBot states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/Assignment ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:
// TODO: update this diagram
image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire JelphaBot.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the task being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

* NUS students who need to manage a large number of tasks
* Prefers using a desktop app over other types
* Wants to distinguish at first glance important and unimportant tasks
* Can type fast; prefers typing over mouse input
* Is reasonably comfortable using CLI (Command Line Interface) applications

*Value proposition*: Using this application will increase the user's efficiency in managing tasks than when
using a typical mouse/GUI driven application. The visual representation of tasks in the UI will also allow the user to
look through entire lists of tasks more quickly than in the terminal.
