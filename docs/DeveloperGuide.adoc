== Preface
=== Introduction

JelphaBot is *a desktop app for managing tasks* for NUS students. JelphaBot is designed to allow these students
to manage tasks conveniently and aids students by *allowing important tasks to be easily recognised*.

Users enter commands in JelphaBot through a *Command Line Interface* (CLI). However, a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
is still used for improved design and user experience.

JelphaBot is based on the AddressBook-Level3 (AB3) project created by SE-EDU initiative at https://se-education.org

=== Purpose of this Document
The following section describes the software architecture and design decisions behind the implementation of JelphaBot.
This guide is intended for developers who wish to maintain, modify or understand the software development behind our application.
The guide is divided into various sections. First, it explores the overarching architecture of the software before exploring each individual component,
as well as the individual implementations of each distinct feature.

The guide is designed to be read as-needed, new developers can choose to start from the overarching view before narrowing down to the specific implementation they require.

This Developer Guide consists of the following sections:

* <<Setting Up, Setting Up>> - Assists new developers in cloning and initializing a copy of JelphaBot.
* <<Design, Design>> - Provides an overview of the architecture design.
* <<Implementation, Implementation>> - Brief explanation of how features in JelphaBot were implemented on top of AB3,
and explains the design considerations of these implementations.
* <<Documentation, Documentation>> - A guide for generating and publishing documentation.
* <<Testing, Testing>> - A guide for developers to set up and run test code.
* <<Dev Ops, Dev Ops>> - A guide for developers to build, test and release JelphaBot.

== Setting Up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

JelphaBot is a desktop app built in Java based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the SE-EDU initiative,
and inherits its architectural design. The software is split into various components, each with its own package.
Each component is in charge of a single aspect of the software.

[TIP]
The data in JelphaBot is stored as .json files in the `data` subdirectory.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture
The *_Architecture Diagram_* given below explains the high-level design of the App.

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram2.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.drawio` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
To update a diagram, import the `.drawio` file to the webapp link:{https://draw.io}[here].

Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}src/main/java/seedu/JelphaBot/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/JelphaBot/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::interaction.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component
The Ui Component handles interactions between the user and the application.
This includes input fields where commands are entered as well as translations of data in the Model Component to a visual representation in the interface.

.Class Diagram of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/JelphaBot/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `CalendarDayCard`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/JelphaBot/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component
The Logic component handles the business logic after a command is executed.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/JelphaBot/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `JelphaBotParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component
The Model component provides an internal data representation of all tasks stored in JelphaBot, as well as methods to modify that data.

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/JelphaBot/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores JelphaBot data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

// TODO ignore this for now
[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `JelphaBot`, which `Task` can reference. This would allow `JelphaBot` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Task` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component
The Storage component manages storing and retrieving of data onto local files in .json format.

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::Storage.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/JelphaBot/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save JelphaBot data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.JelphaBot.commons` package.
This includes classes which implement utility functions which can be used by all other components.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Swap between different Tabs in `MainWindow`
TODO

// tag::taskgroups[]
=== Task Grouping feature in Task List tab
==== Implementation

The task category mechanism is facilitated by the `ViewTaskList` interface, which serves as a wrapper for any list of tasks. +
The ViewTaskList interface supports methods that facilitate getting and iterating through the tasks contained within the list.
This is to accommodate a common access for Tasks in `GroupedTaskList`, which contains multiple sub-lists. +
The diagram below describes the class structure.

.Class Diagram for Task List classes
image::TaskListClassDiagram.png[]

Grouping tasks into sub-lists is done through the `GroupedTaskList` class. +
Each `GroupedTaskList` is a container for `ObservableList<Task>` objects, each containing a unique filter over the full task list.

Each `GroupedTaskList` implements the following operations on top of those in `ViewTaskList`:

* A enum class which describes the valid `Category` groupings, and the corresponding methods of getting these groupings from a `String`. +
* An `ObservableList` of `SubgroupTaskList` that represents the sub-groupings of each corresponding `Category`.
* A public method for instantiating a `GroupedTaskList` called `getGroupedList` with the return from `getFilteredTaskList()` as argument.
* An iterator method which iterates through a list of `SubgroupTaskList`.

Users can modify the `GroupTaskList` being displayed in the main panel by calling a `ListCommand`.
Currently, the supported groupings for JelphaBot are group by date (`GroupedTaskList.Category.DATE` and `GroupedByDateTaskList`)
and group by module (`GroupedTaskList.Category.MODULE` and `GroupedByModuleTaskList`).

The operation for retrieving the corresponding GroupedTaskLists are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#getGroupedTaskList(Category category)`. +
The following diagram shows the sequence flow of a `ListCommand` which modifies the currently shown Task List:

//TODO CHANGE TO SEQUENCE DIAGRAM, with listener
.Activity (Will change to sequence) Diagram for ListCommand
image::ListCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

As `GroupedTaskList` has more than one underlying `ObservableList<Task>`, tasks cannot be retrieved the usual way.
Thus, the `get()` function defined in the `ViewTaskList` interface must be implemented and used instead. +
The following diagram shows the process of retrieving a `Task` from `ViewTaskList`:

.Activity Diagram for `ViewTaskList.get()`
image::GetTaskActivityDiagram.png[]


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the task category mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `MainWindow` will be initialized with `GroupedTaskListPanel` as a container for GroupedTaskList model objects. The panel is populated with sublists defined in `GroupedByDateTaskList`.

Step 2. The user executes `list model` to switch to category tasks by module code instead. `GroupedTaskListPanel` is repopulated with sublists defined in `GroupedByModuleTaskList`.

[NOTE]
If the user tries to switch to a sublist type which is already set, the command fails its execution so that it does not execute the relatively expensive filter operations to make new sublists.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect 1: `ListCommand` swaps to a different `ViewTaskList`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Initializes each grouped list as each `ListCommand` is called and stores the latest list as `Model.lastShownList`.
**  Pros: Easy to implement. Scalable when more groupings are added.
**  Cons: Consecutive 'list' operations are expensive as the list is reinitalized each time.
**  Cons: It is hard to keep track of the exact type of list in `lastShownList`, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
* **Alternative 2:** Keep instances of all `GroupedTaskList` objects and update them as underlying Task List changes.
**  Pros: Consecutive `ListCommand` executions are less expensive.
**  Cons: All other commands that update the underlying list now have additional checks as each grouped list is updated.

===== Aspect 2: `get()` Task from `ViewTaskList` and iterate between Tasks.

* Current solution: Implement `get()` and `Iterator<Task>` in `ViewTaskList`. (Not Done Yet)

===== Aspect 3: Remove empty Categories in `GroupByDateTaskList`

* *Current Solution*: UI displays problems from a `FilteredList<SubgroupTaskList>` and use `setPredicate` to hide empty categories without removing them.
**  Rationale: because these categories are meant to be reused when applicable tasks are added back to the list.
**  Pros: Provides good protection over unexpected changes on the displayed problem list.
**  Cons: Additional load on the UI as the Filtering happens constantly.
* *Alternative 1*: Let UI displays problems in an `ObservableList<Task>` and update the list directly.
**  Pros: This implementation is more straightforward as the logic updates the displayed list directly and all changes are reflected immediately.
**  Cons: `ObservableList` is able to be modified by the containing panel class. Empty `SubgroupTaskList` members have to be hidden manually which requires complex logic.


===== Aspect 4: Remove empty Categories in `GroupByModuleTaskList`

* section does not exist as i have not solved this issue.

// end::taskgroups[]

=== Calendar feature
JelphaBot has a calendar feature which provides an overarching view of their schedules and to allow users to view their tasks due.

This feature offers 3 main functions:

** Display calendar view in a selected month and year
** Display a list of tasks due for a selected date in the month
** Display today's date on calendar view with the corresponding tasks due listed

====  Implementation

**Function 1: Display calendar view in a selected month and year**

In order to change the calendar view for another month and/or year, the user enters the `calendar MONTHYEAR` command +
(e.g. `calendar Apr-2020`)

.Sequence diagram after running `calendar Apr-2020`
image::CalendarViewSequenceDiagram.png[]

Upon the completion of the execution of the command, the calendar view would display the month view for April 2020 instead.

**Function 2: Display a list of tasks due for a selected date in the month**

In order to display the task list for specific input dates, the user enters the `calendar DATE` command +
(e.g. calendar jan-1-2020)

**-insert sequence diagram-**

Upon the completion of the execution of the command, the tasks due on 1st January 2020 would be displayed to the user on the task list panel to the left. +

**Function 3: Display today's date on calendar view with the corresponding tasks due listed**

**-insert sequence diagram-**


=== Productivity feature
JelphaBot has a productivity feature which provides an overarching view of user's overall productivity.

This feature offers two main functions:

** Start timer for a task.
** Stop running timer for a task.

====  Implementation

**Function 1: Starts timer for a specified task** +
In order to start timing a task, the user enters `start INDEX` command
(e.g. start 1)

image::StartSequenceDiagram.png[]

Upon successful execution of the command, the productivity tab displays the task being timed under the Running Timers header.

**Function 2: Stops timer for a specified task** +
In order to stop timing a task, the user enters `stop INDEX` command
(e.g. stop 1)

image::StopSequenceDiagram.png[]

Upon successful execution of the command, the productivity tab removes the task being timed under the Running Timers header.
If the timed task is due today or in the next 6 days, the time spent on the timed task will be added to either the Due today: label
or the Due in the next 6 days: label under the Time Spent on Tasks header.

[NOTE]
If the user attempts to start timer for a task marked as completed or stop a task that does not have a running timer,
the command fails its execution so that it does not execute that start or stop operation to start or stop the timer for that task.

==== Design Considerations

=== Reminder feature
JelphaBot has a reminder feature that reminds users whenever they have tasks that are about to overdue.
This feature offers two main functions:

** Adds a reminder to a task.
** Delete a reminder that is associated to a task.

==== Implementation
**Function 1: Creates a reminder for a specified task** +
To add a reminder to a certain task, the user enters the `reminder INDEX days/DAYS hours/HOURS` command.
(e.g, reminder 2 days/2 hours/1)

image::AddReminderSequenceDiagram.png[]

Upon successful execution of the command, the user adds a reminder associated to the task at `INDEX`. Upon exiting JelphaBot,
the reminder will be saved. By the next time the users starts JelphaBot, it will remind the user should the task's due date fall
within the period set by the user from the current date.

**Function 2: Deletes a reminder for a specified task** +
To delete a reminder associated to a certain task, the user enters the `delrem INDEX` command.
(e.g. delrem 2)

image::DeleteReminderSequenceDiagram.png[]

Upon successful execution of the command, the reminder of the task at `INDEX` is removed.

[NOTE]
If the user attempts to add a reminder to tasks that have reminders, the command will fail to execute. The user also need not
to set reminders to tasks that are complete. However, if tasks that has reminders are not completed, JelphaBot will
still warn the user.

==== Design Considerations



// tag::morningcallnightdebrief[]

=== Morning Call / Night Debrief feature

JelphaBot has a Morning Call and Night Debrief feature which provides an overview of the tasks to be completed
for the day (Morning Call), and all tasks that have been complete within the day (Night Debrief).

Both come in the form of a separate window that opens upon app startup for Morning Call, and app exit for Night Debrief.

==== Implementation

To view the respective tasks, the user enters the `summary` command.

.Sequence of execution of the `summary` command

image::SummarySequenceDiagram.png[]
// end::morningcallnightdebrief[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current JelphaBot state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous JelphaBot state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone JelphaBot state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial JelphaBot state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single JelphaBot state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th task in JelphaBot. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of JelphaBot after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted JelphaBot state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new task. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified JelphaBot state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so JelphaBot state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the task was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous JelphaBot state, and restores JelphaBot to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial JelphaBot state, then there are no previous JelphaBot states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores JelphaBot to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest JelphaBot state, then there are no undone JelphaBot states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify JelphaBot, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all JelphaBot states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire JelphaBot.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the task being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

[appendix]
== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

* NUS students who need to manage a large number of tasks
* Prefers using a desktop app over other types
* Wants to distinguish at first glance important and unimportant tasks
* Can type fast; prefers typing over mouse input
* Is reasonably comfortable using CLI (Command Line Interface) applications

*Value proposition*: Using this application will increase the user's efficiency in managing tasks than when
using a typical mouse/GUI driven application. The visual representation of tasks in the UI will also allow the user to
look through entire lists of tasks more quickly than in the terminal.
